									I was living in London in 2017 during four
									of its bloodiest months in recent history.
									Over the course of three terror attacks, 35
									people were killed. After those attacks, I
									saw a change come over the mood in London.
									Not only was it people grieving together,{" "}
									<strong>
										I saw a people who would do anything to
										keep each other safe.
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Later, in February 2018, I saw similar
									sentiments emerge in the Parkland community
									after the fatal school shooting there â€“
									individuals who would do everything to
									protect each other and their communities,
									kids who are still fighting for changes in
									legislation.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>
										Tembo is founded on the mission to
										empower individuals to protect each
										other and their communities.
									</strong>{" "}
									We are a tech generation that cannot wait
									for legislation to protect us. We want to
									bring everyone together in achieving our
									mission, and we have a plan on how to do so.
									For now, in this first step, we would like
									to ask for your support. Will you help us
									protect one another?
